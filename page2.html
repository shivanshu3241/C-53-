         <p> What we did: <br>
            1. Engineers at Facebook, while working on designing the different complex Facebook apps,
            realized that the declarative style of coding would make their app organization easy.<br>
            2.They developed a new programming language called JSX and a new mobile development
            framework called React Native to help build powerful and complex apps in an easy way.<br>
            3. JSX combines both HTML and Javascript style of coding. JSX is declarative - we tell what are
            the different components we want in the application.<br>
            4. We wrote JSX and React Native code in an online editor called 'snack'.<br>
            5. 'Snack' is an online editor written by Expo, which allows us to write and compile React
            Native code in an online environment. We can also preview the output of the code using
            Snack.<br>
            6. Note: When compared to HTML tags which start with lowercase letters, React native
            components start with uppercase.<br>
            7. A Component is a Base class (Parent class) from which all components are inherited from.<br>
            8. Remember, Baseclass in Angry Birds? and how each of the classes - Bird, Pig, Box -
            extended the Base Class and inherited all its properties and functions?<br>
            9. A Component is a baseclass and all React components are inherited from this baseclass
            Component.<br>
            10. Component class is defined in the React library.<br>
            11. Now you can see that there is only one defined function inside the App Class - it is called
            render()<br>
            12. ‘render()’ function simply displays whatever components are returned by it.<br>
            13. Here, you can see that the <Text> component is returned. So, the <Text> component gets
            rendered or displayed on the screen.<br>
            14. Notice that all the code in the file is Javascript except the code inside render. This is JSX. It
            contains tags which correspond to React Components.
            We can write Javascript inside JSX using { } 'curly brackets<br>
            15. you can also see that the Text component has a style 'property' defined on it. Just like html
            tags have some properties defined on them
            (For example: <img> tag has src, width, height etc.)<br>
            16. "style" property takes a json object {}.<br>
            17. When we are rendering components using JSX tags (<Text>), we can write/execute
            Javascript inside the {}.<br>
            18. You see two {{ }} because one {} says that we are going to write javascript code. The other {}
            is for the json object.<br>
            19. Also, we write CSS properties in React Native in camel case (marginTop instead of
            margin-top)<br>
            20. A render function can return only one React Component. If there are more than one React
            Components that need to be returned, they should be nested inside View.
